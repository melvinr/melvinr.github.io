#Browser Technologies 1.2 - Fork je Funda
##Feature 1 - Images
When turning off images on the Funda Shaker app, you will quickly notice that there is very little to see on a page. The only thing on the page is a little bit of information. Even though it is of course quite logical that there is not a lot to see on the page, since images are its main ingredient. There is room for improvement here. It is a shame that the space that was normally taken up by the images, has now fallen away, causing the information to move up to the top of the page. By adding a textual placeholder, you can provide extra information on the house. This shifts the main content of this page from images to textual information.
