##HTML
###Video tag
Nowadays videos are an important media source on the web. But there is a problem using the video tag, since not every browser supports it. Luckily, nowadays almost all browsers support it. Except for Opera Mini and IE 8 and below.

####Fallback
It is important to create a fallback for the users that visit your websites on these browsers. A good fallback for videos is to provide textual and/or visual feedback on why it doesn't show a video. To enable the user to still watch the video, you can add a download link as a fallback. Allowing them to watch the video locally.
